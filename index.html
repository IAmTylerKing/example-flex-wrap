                    Born and raised in Chicago, currently resided in the south suburbs. I plan to eventually
                    move to another city, such as Seattle, Dallas, and New York. I'm very curious of the world but I
                    want to start with exploring my nation.

                    My passions: Are learning, gaming, and creating. I've been a gamer since the age of 10,
                    it seems to be something that will be with me forever. Learning as a passion is the best thing
                    to ever happen to me. I've been developing my creativty to continue to grow as a person.

                    Fun fact about me: I live in the city where the great Michael Jordan won the Chicago Bulls
                    6 NBA championships. Michael Jordan's impact on the city with his signature shoe brand Jordan,
                    has become a major part of my city which leads to my biggest hobby of collecting some of
                    Jordan's most popular shoes throughout the years.
